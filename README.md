## Usage Guide

### 1. Using GreenLightPlus to Create Greenhouse Geometry Files

The GreenLightPlus package allows users to create greenhouse geometrical models with different roof types to support environment simulations. Here's how to use the `GreenhouseGeometry` class to generate greenhouses with various roof types.

#### Quick Start

First, you need to import the `GreenhouseGeometry` class from GreenLightPlus. Then, you can specify different roof types and generate a greenhouse model for each type.

```python
from GreenLightPlus import GreenhouseGeometry

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define different roof types
    roof_types = [
        "triangle",
        "half_circle",
        "flat_arch",
        "gothic_arch",
        "sawtooth",
        "sawtooth_arch",
    ]

    for roof_type in roof_types:
        print(f"Creating greenhouse with {roof_type} roof")
        # Set basic greenhouse parameters
        wall_height = 6.5  # Ridge height {m}
        wall_width = 4     # Width of each roof segment {m}
        wall_length = 1.67 # Greenhouse length {m}
        num_segments = 6   # Number of roof segments
        slope = 22         # Roof slope angle {°}
        number_length = 10 # Number of greenhouses in length direction
        number_width = 10  # Number of greenhouses in width direction
        time_step = 60     # Time step (minutes)

        # Create a GreenhouseGeometry instance
        greenhouse_model = GreenhouseGeometry(
            roof_type=roof_type,
            slope=slope,
            wall_height=wall_height,
            wall_width=wall_width,
            wall_length=wall_length,
            num_segments=num_segments,
            time_step=time_step,
            number_width=number_width,
            number_length=number_length,
            max_indoor_temp=60,
            min_indoor_temp=0,
            max_outdoor_temp=60,
            min_outdoor_temp=0,
            max_delta_temp=1,
            max_wind_speed=30,
            start_month=4,
            start_day=1,
            end_month=4,
            end_day=7,
        )

        # Generate the greenhouse model
        greenhouse_model.create_houses()
```

#### Functionality Description

With the above code, you can create greenhouse geometrical models with different roof types. These models can be used for further environment simulations and energy consumption analysis. You can adjust the parameters of the `GreenhouseGeometry` class to suit your specific needs, such as modifying the greenhouse dimensions, roof type, or the simulation time range.

This functionality is the foundation for understanding and using the GreenLightPlus package, suitable for users who need to perform preliminary simulations and analyses on different greenhouse designs.

### 2. Using GreenLightPlus to Run the Original GreenLight Model and Plot Results

The GreenLightPlus package allows users to run greenhouse simulations using the original GreenLight model and analyze and visualize the results. Here are detailed steps on how to set simulation parameters, run the simulation, and use the `plot_green_light` function to display the results.

#### Quick Start

First, import the necessary modules and functions from the GreenLightPlus package.

```python
from GreenLightPlus import (
    GreenLightModel,
    extract_last_value_from_nested_dict,
    calculate_energy_consumption,
    plot_green_light,
)

# Set the growing season length and time interval for the model run
season_length = 7  # Growing season, can be a fraction of days
season_interval = 7  # Time interval for each model run, can be a fraction of days, e.g., 1/24/4 for 15 minutes
first_day = 91  # Date of the first day of the growing season

# Create a GreenLightModel instance
model = GreenLightModel(first_day=first_day, isMature=False, epw_path="NLD_Amsterdam.062400_IWEC.epw")

# Initialize the model state
init_state = {
    "p": {
        # Greenhouse structure settings
        'psi': 22,  # Mean greenhouse cover slope [degrees]
        'aFlr': 4e4,  # Floor area [m^2]
        'aCov': 4.84e4,  # Surface of the cover including side walls [m^2]
        # Height of the main compartment [m] (the ridge height is 6.3, screen is 20 cm below it)
        'hAir': 6.3,
        'hGh': 6.905,  # Mean height of the greenhouse [m]
        'aRoof': 0.1169*4e4,  # Maximum roof ventilation area
        'hVent': 1.3,  # Vertical dimension of single ventilation opening [m]
        'cDgh': 0.75,  # Ventilation discharge coefficient [-]
        'lPipe': 1.25,  # Length of pipe rail system [m m^-2]
        # Capacity of CO2 injection for the entire greenhouse [mg s^-1]
        'phiExtCo2': 7.2e4*4e4/1.4e4,
        'pBoil': 300*4e4,  # Capacity of boiler for the entire greenhouse [W]

        # Control settings
        'co2SpDay': 1000,  # CO2 setpoint during the light period [ppm]
        'tSpNight': 18.5,  # temperature set point dark period [°C]
        'tSpDay': 19.5,  # temperature set point light period [°C]
        'rhMax': 87,  # maximum relative humidity [%]
        # P-band for ventilation due to high temperature [°C]
        'ventHeatPband': 4,
        # P-band for ventilation due to high relative humidity [% humidity]
        'ventRhPband': 50,
        # P-band for screen opening due to high relative humidity [% humidity]
        'thScrRhPband': 10,
        'lampsOn': 0,  # time of day (in morning) to switch on lamps [h]
        'lampsOff': 18,  # time of day (in evening) to switch off lamps [h]
        # lamps are switched off if global radiation is above this value [W m^-2]
        'lampsOffSun': 400,
        # Predicted daily radiation sum from the sun where lamps are not used that day [MJ m^-2 day^-1]
        'lampRadSumLimit': 10
    }
}

# Run the model based on the set growing season and time interval
for current_step in range(int(season_length // season_interval)):
    gl = model.run_model(gl_params=init_state, season_length=season_length, season_interval=season_interval, step=current_step)
    init_state = gl
    dmc = 0.06  # Dry matter conversion coefficient

    # Calculate and print the current yield
    current_yield = 1e-6 * calculate_energy_consumption(gl, 'mcFruitHar') / dmc
    print(f"current yield is {current_yield} kg/m2")

# Visualize the simulation results
plot_green_light(gl)
```

#### Functionality Description

This example code demonstrates how to use the GreenLightModel class to run greenhouse environment simulations. By looping through the growing season, the simulation steps through the environmental changes, and the `calculate_energy_consumption` function is used to evaluate energy consumption and yield. Finally, the `plot_green_light` function visualizes the results of the entire simulation process, showing the changes in various environmental parameters inside the greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting and heating energy consumption over time.

#### Result Display

The `plot_green_light` function will generate a chart displaying the changes in environmental parameters inside and outside the greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, as well as lighting and heating energy consumption. This will help users evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation and optimize the greenhouse design.

### 3. Using GreenLightPlus to Run Combined GreenLight and EnergyPlus Simulations

GreenLightPlus integrates the GreenLight model and EnergyPlus, providing higher accuracy greenhouse environment simulations and more detailed energy consumption analyses.

#### Quick Start

First, ensure that you have added the EnergyPlus installation directory to the Python module search path. Then, import the required modules and functions from the GreenLightPlus package.

```python
import sys
# Add the EnergyPlus installation directory to the Python module search path
sys.path.insert(0, "./EnergyPlus")

from GreenLightPlus import GreenhouseSimulation, convert_epw2csv
from pyenergyplus.api import EnergyPlusAPI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an EnergyPlus API object
    api = EnergyPlusAPI()

    # Set the paths for the weather file and model file
    epw_path = "NLD_Amsterdam.062400_IWEC.epw"
    idf_path = "data/model_files/greenhouse_half_circle.idf"

    # Convert the EPW weather file to a CSV file for easier processing
    csv_path = convert_epw2csv(epw_path=epw_path, time_step=1)

    # Set the output directory
    output_directory = "data/energyPlus/outputs"

    # Set the start date and number of days for the simulation
    first_day = 91
    season_length = 7

    # Create an instance of the GreenhouseSimulation class
    simulation = GreenhouseSimulation(api, epw_path, idf_path, csv_path, output_directory, first_day, season_length, isMature=True)

    # Run the simulation
    simulation.run()

    # Get the simulation results
    total_yield, lampIn, boilIn = simulation.get_results()
    print(f"Total yield: {total_yield} kg/m2, Lamp input: {lampIn} MJ/m2, Boiler input: {boilIn} MJ/m2\n")
```

#### Functionality Description

This example code demonstrates how to use the `GreenhouseSimulation` class and the EnergyPlus API to run greenhouse environment simulations that combine the GreenLight model with EnergyPlus. This simulation will use EnergyPlus for detailed energy consumption analysis, while incorporating the crop growth and environmental control models provided by GreenLight.

#### Result Display

After the simulation is completed, statistics on total yield, lighting input, and boiler input will be output. This data helps users evaluate the effectiveness of the greenhouse design and control strategies, as well as their impact on energy consumption and yield.
